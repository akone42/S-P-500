# Project: Analysis of S&P 500 Company Financials

This project presents an in-depth exploratory and statistical analysis of a dataset containing financial metrics for S&P 500 companies. Using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, scipy), the project examines correlations, sector-based differences, and high-level patterns within the dataset.

### Key Highlights:
- **Data Cleaning & EDA**: Identified outliers, handled missing P/E values, and visualized distributions of key variables.
- **Correlation & Regression**: Found a statistically significant relationship between EPS and stock price, with a $1 EPS increase corresponding to a ~$14.85 increase in price.
- **Profitability Stratification**: Demonstrated that EPS-price correlation is strong in profitable firms but disappears for unprofitable ones.
- **Clustering**: Applied K-Means (k=6) on normalized features to group companies into distinct financial profiles (e.g., Mega-Cap Growth Leaders, Reliable Income Producers).
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Used t-tests and chi-squared tests to compare volatility, dividend yields, and the association between sectors and market cap categories.
- **Insights**: Found that mega-cap firms tend to reinvest earnings rather than pay high dividends, and that volatility is not strongly tied to EPS alone.

### Technologies Used:
- Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, scipy
- Techniques: Linear Regression, Clustering, Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization
